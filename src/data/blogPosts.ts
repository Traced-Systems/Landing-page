            '"SCAN THE QR CODE"\n\nIdentification: Under ESPR and the EU Batteries Regulation, batteries must have a unique identifier (e.g., serial, batch, or model). From February 2027, QR codes linked to a digital battery passport will provide robust identification and information access.\n\n\nEssential characteristics: Under the EU Battery Regulation, batteries must be accompanied by information such as production date, battery type and model, chemical composition, and the name and address of the manufacturer or importer, with this data accessible through the Battery Passport.\n\n\nPerformance and worlking life: Under the ESPR legislation, parties conducting the repair or repurposing of batteries are expected to update technical information over the battery lifecycle, including details on how this data was obtained.\n\n\n\nThe Battery Regulation requires many other criteria to be met to sell batteries in the EU, including that all batteries must be recycled in an approved manner. Here are some of the main requirements that must be met:\n\nFacilitate repair and end-of-life processing: Information must be made electronically available to all parties conducting any repair or end-of-life processing, as well as end users to facilitate collection schemes for end-of-life batteries.\n\n\nIncrease recycled content: Batteries must contain a minimum of 16% cobalt, 85% lead, 6% lithium, and 6% nickel from non-virgin sources by 2031.\n\n\nCalculate carbon footprint and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions: Battery producers will be obligated to report the carbon footprint associated with the overall life cycle (excluding the use phase) of the specific manufacturing batch of batteries\n\n\nBattery health data: Must be made available to the battery owner in order to determine the potential for further use, repurposing, or remanufacturing.\n\n\nConformity declarations: Before a battery can be placed on the EU market, it must have a conformity assessment conducted by a notified body.\n\n\nSafety and hazardous materials: Must include evidence that they are safe during their normal operation. All batteries cannot contain materials which present a hazard to humans or the environment during all stages of the battery life cycle.\n\n\nBattery supply chain due diligence requirements: As of 12 months after the proposed Battery Regulation update is implemented, companies selling EV and industrial batteries on the EU market must conduct supply chain due diligence to mitigate social and environmental risks. All information must be made available to the public, to authorities upon request, and to downstream customers.',

Collecting information on energy and utility consumption, production metrics, and quality control is crucial for bringing the battery passport concept to life.\n\n\nData management: Implementing a digital system at the manufacturing plant level involves deploying smart software solutions to collect and integrate data from hardware, linking it to a unique product ID, thereby creating a comprehensive product history and identikit throughout its lifecycle.",
