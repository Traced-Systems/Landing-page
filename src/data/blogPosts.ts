Here are some of the main requirements that must be met:\n\nFacilitate repair and end-of-life processing: Information must be made electronically available to all parties conducting any repair or end-of-life processing, as well as end users to facilitate collection schemes for end-of-life batteries.\n\n\nIncrease recycled content: Batteries must contain a minimum of 16% cobalt, 85% lead, 6% lithium, and 6% nickel from non-virgin sources by 2031.\n\n\nCalculate carbon footprint and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions: Battery producers will be obligated to report the carbon footprint associated with the overall life cycle (excluding the use phase) of the specific manufacturing batch of batteries\n\n\nBattery health data: Must be made available to the battery owner in order to determine the potential for further use, repurposing, or remanufacturing.\n\n\nConformity declarations: Before a battery can be placed on the EU market, it must have a conformity assessment conducted by a notified body.\n\n\nSafety and hazardous materials: Must include evidence that they are safe during their normal operation. All batteries cannot contain materials which present a hazard to humans or the environment during all stages of the battery life cycle.\n\n\nBattery supply chain due diligence requirements: As of 12 months after the proposed Battery Regulation update is implemented, companies selling EV and industrial batteries on the EU market must conduct supply chain due diligence to mitigate social and environmental risks.
